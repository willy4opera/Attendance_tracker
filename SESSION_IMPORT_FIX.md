## Fix Summary for SessionList.tsx Import Error

### Issue:
SessionList.tsx was trying to import from 'session.service.ts' but the file had incorrect exports.

### Root Cause:
1. There were duplicate session service files (session.service.ts and sessionService.ts)
2. The exports were not properly configured
3. Missing SessionFilters interface

### Fixes Applied:
1. Updated imports in SessionList.tsx to use 'sessionService' instead of 'session.service'
2. Added SessionFilters interface to sessionService.ts
3. Fixed toast import to use 'toastHelpers' instead of 'toast'
4. Removed duplicate session.service.ts files to avoid confusion

### Updated Import Statement:
```typescript
import sessionService, { type Session, type SessionFilters } from '../../services/sessionService';
```

The error should now be resolved.
