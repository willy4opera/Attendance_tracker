## Fixed TypeScript Import Issue

### Problem:
Components were trying to import both default export and named exports in the same line:
```typescript
import attendanceService, { AttendanceRecord } from '../../services/attendanceService';
```

### Solution:
Separated the imports to use proper TypeScript syntax:
```typescript
import attendanceService from '../../services/attendanceService';
import type { AttendanceRecord } from '../../services/attendanceService';
```

### Files Fixed:
- AttendanceHistory.tsx
- AttendanceDashboard.tsx
- AttendancePage.tsx

This ensures proper module resolution and type imports in TypeScript.
