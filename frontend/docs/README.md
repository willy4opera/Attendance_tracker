# Attendance Tracker Frontend Documentation

This directory contains documentation for the frontend implementation of the Attendance Tracker application.

## 📋 Task Dependency Implementation

### Overview
The task dependency system allows users to create relationships between tasks, supporting four types of dependencies commonly used in project management:

- **FS (Finish-to-Start)**: Task B cannot start until Task A finishes
- **SS (Start-to-Start)**: Task B cannot start until Task A starts  
- **FF (Finish-to-Finish)**: Task B cannot finish until Task A finishes
- **SF (Start-to-Finish)**: Task B cannot finish until Task A starts
